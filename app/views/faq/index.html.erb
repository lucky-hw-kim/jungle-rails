          In the case of plant purchases, a customer is entitled to a 100% refund if the plant is dead within 30 days of purchase, provided that the plant has been cared for according to the instructions. This policy does not apply to plants that have been damaged due to neglect or abuse. A refund policy is a statement that outlines the conditions under which a customer is entitled to a refund. This can include circumstances such as if the product is defective or if the customer is not satisfied with the purchase. The refund policy should be clearly stated on the receipt or on a sign in the store.

          The plant is called "Lactuca virosa" and is a member of the daisy family. It is a tall plant, growing up to 2.5 meters in height, with a hollow stem and large, lobed leaves. The leaves are dark green in color and have a bitter taste. The plant flowers in summer, producing small, yellow flowers. The entire plant is edible, though the leaves are the most commonly eaten part. The leaves can be eaten raw or cooked, and are often used in salads. The flowers and stems can also be eaten, and are sometimes used to decorate dishes. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine, and is still used today to treat a variety of conditions.
